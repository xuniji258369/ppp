CJK Unicode font Ming style
===========================

This font was taken from the from the TrueType fonts generously released by 
Arphic Technologies Taiwan under the Arphic Public License.
It was modified with Fontforge by Arne Goetje <arne@linux.org.tw> to contain 
both Big5 and GB2312 charsets plus some european characters.

Currently it fully supports the following charsets:
ISO8859-1,2,3,4,7,9,10,13,14,15
Big5
GB2312-80
Bopomofo Extensions for Hakka, Minnan (Unicode 4.0) and MBE variants using 
the Stylistic Alternatives (salt) feature from the OTF spec.

Partly support is implemented for:
HKSCS
CNS 11643
GB18030
Japanese
Korean

This font is under development, new glyphs for the partly supported charsets 
are constantly added.

This package contains now both variants, Unicode and MBE. However, only the 
Unicode variant is provided as a TTF. In most cases you just need the Unicode 
variant. If you want to install the MBE variant, you need to use xdelta 1.1.3 
to patch the TTF.

xdelta patch uming2mbe.xdelta uming.ttf umingmbe.ttf

Xdelta is available on http://www.xdelta.org or for Windows users on
http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~ejones/software/xdelta-win32.html

IMPORTANT: Only use version 1.1.3, not newer ones, they won't work!

If you use fontconfig (>= 2.3.1), you can copy the ttf-arphic-uming file to /etc/fonts/conf.d/ and run fc-cache to update the fontconfig cache.
