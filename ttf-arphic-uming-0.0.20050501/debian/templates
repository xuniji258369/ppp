_Choices: Unicode, MBE, Both
Default: Unicode
_Description: Font variant to install:
 This font contains bopomofo extended glyphs, which are used to annotate
 Chinese glyphs to show how the characters should be pronounced. These
 bopomofo extended glyphs are used for some minority languages, like
 Taiwanese and Hakka. They are mainly used in Taiwan.
 .
 There are two variants of these bopomofo extended glyphs in use, one which
 conforms to the Unicode standard, and one, called Modern Bopomofo
 Extensions (MBE), which aims to be easier to read and write.
 .
 The Unicode variant also contains the MBE variants encoded as TTF
 stylistic alternatives (SALT). As only few programs can support this
 feature, users who prefer to use the MBE glyphs should install the MBE
 variant. More information on this can be found on the project homepage:

 .
 If in doubt, please select "Unicode".
